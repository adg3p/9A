It's highly unlikely that all parameter's of a galaxy could be determined using just one very large telescope, no matter how powerful it is.

1> Different wavelengths reveal different things: Galaxies emit radiatio In across a wide range of wavelengths, from natio waves to visible light to gamma rays. Each wavelength tells us something. different about the galaxy's composition, structure 4 activity.

For example:- -Visible light: Shows the distribution of 'stans & clust in the galaxy'set disk.

Radio waves: Revetsals the presence of gas & regions of star formation.

X-rays. Indicates the presence of black hole & hot gases.

A single telescope would be limited to observing in a specific range of wavelengths, missing crucial information. about the gt galaxy's other aspects.

2) Specialized instruments needed for different measurements. â€¢ Even within the same wavelength range, different instrumen ts ne needed to measure are different parameters.

For example:

-Spectrographs:- Split light into its component colores, revealing the chemical composition of stars 4 gas.

-Interferometers - Measure the size 4 structure of very distant galaxies with high precision.

A single telescope might not have all the necessary instruments onboard to capture all the requined mea- -Surements.

3) Observing time limitations! - lange telescopes are in high de- -mand, & observing time is precious. It wouldn't be practical or efficient to use one telescope for all the

observations needed to fully characterize a galaxy, especially for fainter or more distant ones. = Examples Imagine trying to understand a forest using only one tool, like a flashlight. You might see the trees in front of you, but you wouldn't known anything about the undergrowth, the insects living there, on the overall ecosystem. Studying a gala Xy is similar, different tools [telescopes & instruments) are needed to neaveal its complete picture.

In conclusion, while incredibly powerful telescopes can gather vast amounts of data about galaxies, a single one cannot capture all the necessary informa -tion to determine all their parameters It's a team effort requiring multiple instruments, wavelengths, & spedalized techniques to unravel the mysteries of these magnificent cosmic system.
